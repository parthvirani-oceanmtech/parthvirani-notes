## History
- Thompson and Dennis Richie of Bell Laboratories developed UNIX operating system in 1969.
- Linux Torvalds develop the Linux kernel in 1991
- Kernal control pretty much everything that happens on the system.

## Choosing a Linux Distribution

- Linux system is divided into three main parts:
	- Hardware - This includes all hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.
	- Linux Kernal - This is a core of the operating system, which manages hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.
	- User Space - This is where users like us will directly interact with the system.
- There are many Linux distributions to choose from, here are the most popular options.

### Debian
- Overview
	- Debian is an operating system compressed entirely of free and open-source software.
	- it has three branches Stable, Testing, and Unstable.
- Package Management
	- Debian also uses Debian Package Management tools.
	- Every Linux distribution has different package management tools.
- Configurability
	- Debian may not get the latest updates, but it's extremely stable.
	- This is the one if we want a good "core" operating system.
- Uses
	- Debian is an overall operating system for any platform.

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Overview
	- Red hat enterprise Linux is commonly referred to as RHEL and is developed by red hat.
	- It has strict rules to restrict free re-distribution but still, source codes are free.
- Package Management
	- RHEL uses a different package manager than Debian, RPM Package Manager.
- Configurability
	- RHEL-based operating systems will differ slightly from Debian-Based systems.
	- most noticeably in package management.
- Uses:
	- As per the name described it is mostly used in the enterprise, so if we need a solid server OS this will be one.

### Ubuntu
- Overview
	- One of the most popular Linux distributions for personal machines.
	- Ubuntu also release its desktop environment manager.
- Package Management
	- Ubuntu is Debian based operating system developed by Canonical, so it uses a core Debian package management system.
- Configurability
	- Great choice for beginners to get into Linux.
	- It offers a great user interface and which is why the wide adoption of Linux happens.
	- It most liked other operating systems like OSX and windows in terms of uses
- Uses
	- Great for any platform, Desktop, Laptop, and server.

### Fedora
- Overview
	- Backed by a Red hat.
	- Fedora is a community-driven containing open source and free software.
	- Red hat enterprise Linux branches off a fedora.
	- it's like upstream of the RHEL operating system.
	- Eventually, REHL will get updates from fedora after testing and quality assurance.
	- Fedora is an Ubuntu equivalent that uses Red Hat backend instead Debian.
- Package Management
	- Uses Red hat package management.
- configurable
	- If we want to use a red hat-based operating system, then this is a user-friendly version.
- Uses
	- Fedora is great if we want to use a red hat-based OS without pricing tags, recommended for desktop and laptop

### Other OS
- There is other os Like Linux Mint, Gentoo, Arch Linux, CentOS, Kali Linux, etc, but based on our use we will eventually have anyone from tons of Linux os.
